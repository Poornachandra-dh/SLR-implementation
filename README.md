📈 Simple Linear Regression This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning technique used to predict a dependent variable based on a single independent variable.
🔍 What’s Inside:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

Building a linear regression model using:

Scikit-learn

Manual (custom equation-based) approach

Model evaluation using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

📊 Use Case:
Predicting outcomes such as:

House prices based on size

Sales based on advertising budget

Student scores based on study hours

🚀 Tools & Libraries:
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn
